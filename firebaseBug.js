The Firebase Realtime Database sometimes throws a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error even when the security rules appear correctly configured.  This often happens when there's a mismatch between the rules defined in the Firebase console and the actual data structure being accessed. For example, if your rules allow access to `/users/{userId}/profile`, but you try to access `/users/{userId}/profile/settings`, it will result in a permission denied error because the rules don't explicitly cover the nested `settings` node.
