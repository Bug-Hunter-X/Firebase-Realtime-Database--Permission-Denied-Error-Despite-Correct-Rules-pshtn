The solution is to ensure your security rules explicitly cover all paths accessed by your application.  If you're accessing nested data, you need to specify those nested paths in the rules.   Here's an example fix.  This assumes you have a user object that contains a profile with nested settings:

```javascript
// Correct Security Rules
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$userId": {
        "profile": {
          ".read": "auth != null",
          ".write": "auth != null",
          "settings": {
            ".read": "auth != null",
            ".write": "auth != null"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This explicitly grants read and write access to both the `profile` and `profile/settings` nodes.
