This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Firebase Realtime Database security rules.  The error, a `PERMISSION_DENIED`, occurs even when the rules appear correct. The root cause is usually a mismatch between the structure specified in the rules and the actual data being accessed.  The `firebaseBug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a fix.
